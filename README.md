# Dune

Dune is an open-source, cross-platform, shell around the **V8** engine, written in **Rust** and capable of running JavaScript (dah) and TypeScript code out of the box.

Developed completely for fun and experimentation.

## Installation

**Mac, Linux:**

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aalykiot/dune/main/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aalykiot/dune/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

> Otherwise you have to manually download and unzip the <a href="https://github.com/aalykiot/dune/releases/latest/download/dune-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip">release</a> build.

**From Source:**

Clone the repo and build it using <a href="https://rustup.rs/">Cargo</a>.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aalykiot/dune.git && cd ./dune && cargo build --release
```

> Make sure to create a `.dune` directory under your user.

## Getting Started

A simple example.

```js
import shortid from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/shortid';

console.log(shortid()); //=> "lXN1aGba2"
```

Another example using the net module.

```js
import net from 'net';

const server = net.createServer(async (socket) => {
  console.log('Got new connection!');
  await socket.write('Hello! ðŸ‘‹\n');
  await socket.destroy();
});

server.listen(3000, '127.0.0.1', () => {
  console.log('Server is listening on port 3000...');
});
```

JSX/TSX files are also supported for server side rendering.

```jsx
import { h, Component } from 'https://esm.sh/preact@10.11.3';
import { render } from 'https://esm.sh/preact-render-to-string@5.2.6';

/** @jsx h */

// Classical components work.
class Fox extends Component {
  render({ name }) {
    return <span class="fox">{name}</span>;
  }
}

// ... and so do pure functional components:
const Box = ({ type, children }) => (
  <div class={`box box-${type}`}>{children}</div>
);

let html = render(
  <Box type="open">
    <Fox name="Finn" />
  </Box>
);

console.log(html);
```
